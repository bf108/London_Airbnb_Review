## Dataset

Data was collected from [InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)

The data consists of information regarding property listings, reviews, and calendars outlining occupancy.

Calendar Data for 2020 and 2019 both have 6 features.

2020 has 31,521,054 entries.
2019 has 29,077,102 entries.

This contains booking details for year ahead for each property id. This data will be used to look at the difference in activity with Covid-19.

The listing data set has 27 features and 84,329 entries. This data will be used to understand which neighbourhoods and postcode provide the cheapest and most expensive accommodation.

From this analysis I hope to determine a better understand of seasonal variation in letting prices, neighbourhood effects of price and perceived customer value and finally the impact of Covid on the letting sector.

## Summary of Findings

**Customer Advice**

After reviewing the data from AirBnB I would give the following guidance to customers...

 - Where possible avoid the Christmas Season as prices in tend to increase at this point. You may end up paying up to 15% more than if you were to visit in May.
 - I would also avoid staying in Central London (Kensington, Westminster, City of London, Hammersmith & Fulham) because you pay a disproportionately higher price. Surrounding neighbourhoods from Central such as Lambeth and Hackney offer the benefit of much cheaper accommodation whilst only being a short bus or tube ride into town.
 - Perceived customer value also increases outside of Central London. If value is what you are seeking, then it would be worth checking out Kingston and Richmond.

**Market Outlook**

In terms of a market outlook, the next 6 months look quite tough for Hosts. Comparing the booking pipeline of 2019 to 2020 shows occupancy rates are predicted to be down year-on-year until October. Occupancy levels will fall until June before seeing an uptick. Occupancy level are due to be down 7% in June.

The data would suggest that this is due to the combined effect of Covid-19 and a 12% increase in lettings on the market. The Government has imposed travel restrictions and recommended that all employees work from home where possible. This has resulted in a significant fall in activity in the Capital. Combining this with the increased supply of accommodation has resulted in an over supply of accommodation which has depreciated occupancy levels.
